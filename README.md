# Multithreaded-Prime-Number-Calculator
A parallel computing solution that efficiently counts and sums prime numbers up to a user-specified maximum using multiple threads. The program implements data parallelism by dividing the computational workload across a user-defined number of POSIX threads, demonstrating significant performance improvements over single-threaded approaches.
